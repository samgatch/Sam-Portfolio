		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi my name is Sam Gascho and I'm a 22 year old trying to make a jump
			into the career I've always been encapsulated with. Since I was young,
			I've always had a love for all things electroning. After spending 2 years
			as an electrical engineering major unforseen circumstances have caused me to move
			home and not finish my degree. After two years of self taught learning I've decided
			to put myself on the market for getting a foot into the web development field.
